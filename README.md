# Avocado-price-Kaggle

data is from the kagge website.
The job is do EDA on the data and see if there is some pattern on that .

I did import the data from csv and do the EDA.
find the meaning of the column .(like region , type)
Most analyse is time series of total volume and average price .
covert date to date time , resampling abd windows rolling .
for the chart I used mostly seaborn .

All the assumption , issues and conclusion is in the jupyter notebook file .
