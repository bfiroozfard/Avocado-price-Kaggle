# Avocado-price-Kaggle

Data is from the kagge website:  https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices

I did EDA on the data and checked  if there is some pattern on that .
* import the data from csv and do the EDA.
* finding the meaning of the column .(like region , type)
* Most analyse is time series of total volume and average price .
* covert date to date time , resampling abd windows rolling .
* for the chart I used mostly seaborn .

## All the assumption , issues and conclusion is in the jupyter notebook file .
